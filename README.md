# Git Started

## Story

With this project we try to learn Git version control system. The name Git comes from "global information tracker".
Git does have a reputation of being obscure and hard to use. Git is just a tool created by developers for developers to help them work together and collaborate more easily on a project.
Many projects are handled using Git, and this project covers the necessary basics of Git usage.

## What are we going to learn?

- Clone a remote repository from GitHub.
- Add and modify files.
- Create commits.
- Handle excluded files.
- Push the result back to the remote server.
